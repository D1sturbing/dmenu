#dmenu - dynamic menu
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.

# Configuring dmenu

The configuration of dmenu is done by editing either config.h/config.def.h/config.mk
and (re)compiling the source code. It is good practice to back up your working build of dmenu and apply patches/modifications to a copy before merging the two.
Also, modifying config.def.h instead of config.h is encouraged, as well as removing the generated config.h file before recompiling as leaving it can cause issues that will prevent you from recompiling. But i'm not your dad, so you can do whatever you want.

# D1sturbed's build

Just clone this repo and compile with the following command:
```
  $ make clean install
 ```
dmenu should put it's binary in ```/usr/local/bin``` by default, but if it doesn't work, you can run that command as root too, it's what i do.
